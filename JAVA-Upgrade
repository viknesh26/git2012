                          UPGRADE TO HIGHER VERSION OF JAVA 

1.	To remove OpenJDK (the one you've already installed)
sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\*
2.	Make a new directory for your new JDK
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/java
3.	Copy the file to the directory (you should be in that file path)
sudo cp -r jdk-8u45-linux-x64.tar.gz /usr/local/java/
4.	Extract the file
sudo tar xvzf jdk-8u45-linux-x64.tar.gz
5.	You should add this to your PATH now. To do that:
a. Open /etc/profile : sudo gedit /etc/profile
b. Scroll down (the end) and add the path where your jdk was installed
JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_45 PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin export JAVA_HOME export PATH
Save and exit
6.	Inform your Linux system where your Oracle Java JDK/JRE is located.
a. Notify the system that Oracle Java JRE is available for use
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/java" 1
b. Notify the system that Oracle Java JDK is available for use
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/javac" 1
c. Notify the system that Oracle Java Web start is available for use
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_20/bin/javaws" 1
7.	Inform your Linux system that Oracle Java JDK/JRE must be the default Java.
a. Set the java runtime environment for the system
sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/java
b. Set the javac compiler for the system
sudo update-alternatives --set javac /usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/javac
c. Set Java Web start for the system
sudo update-alternatives --set javaws /usr/local/java/jdk1.8.0_20/bin/javaws
8.	Reload your system wide PATH
source /etc/profile
9.	Check the new version and you're done!
java -version
